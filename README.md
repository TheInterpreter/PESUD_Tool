# PESUD A.K.A Penetration and Extraction of Structured and Undestructured Data (p.e.s.u.d) Toolkit
## It is a toolkit created with the purpose of testing the security measures of remote data storage facilities.
**NOTES:** PESUD is just being developed so this is an ongoing _backlog_, not a product description.


***BACKLOG*:**
- Scan open ports of a given IP
  - Sniffes packages being transferred. 
  - If unencrypted, filter JSON, SQL, XML open formats. 
- Creates a false-positive stream for disfunctional IPS using [inundator](http://inundator.sourceforge.net/)
