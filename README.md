# PESUD A.K.A Penetration and Extraction of Structured and Undestructured Data (p.e.s.u.d) Tool
## It is a tool created with the purpose of testing the security measures of remote data storage facilities.
**NOTES:** PESUD is just being developed so this is an ongoing _backlog_, not a product description.
           PESUD must be used with the explicit permission of the owner of the information & system being handled. It's to be considered a security tool, NOT a black-hat hacking software. 


***BACKLOG*:**
- PESUD is divided in **works**.
  - **EPIC 1:** A primary **work** of PESUD is to penetrate in the network. Once it has penetrated it must mantain
  - **EPIC 2:** A Data **work** performs a particular task associated with prospecting, sniffing, decrypting and copying high-volume of packages being transferred through a network
- Scan open ports of a given IP
  - Sniffes packages being transferred. 
  - If unencrypted, filter JSON, SQL, XML open formats. 
- Creates a false-positive stream for disfunctional IPS using [inundator](http://inundator.sourceforge.net/)
